# Front-end developer activity for Cynch candidates. #
***Version 0.1***

### What is this repository for? ###

This repo is a representative example of code from the Cynch Partner Portal.
The purpose of the repo is to provide front-end developer candaidates with practical activities they can complete to demonstrate their capabilities.

### How do I get set up? ###

Cynch front-end code is built using the Ionic Framework. This repo was tested using:

* Ionic 6
* Node v16

All other prerequisites are captured in the included `package.json` file.

To get started with Ionic, follow the **Environment Setup** and **CLI Installation documentation** here:

* Ionic setup: https://ionicframework.com/docs

Once installed, clone this repo locally and launch the app using the `ionic serve` command.

## Activity guidelines ##

Once up and running, explore the app and complete as many of the following tasks as you wish:

1. On the **Team Profile** page the second number under ***Businesses** is incorrectly displaying the number of businesses, not the number of partner licenses as expected. Update the page to display the `licenses` field from the `partner` object. The result should be `3/70`.
2. The **Team Profile** does not currently display neatly on a mobile screen size. Update the layout to be responsive to a mobile screen.
3. The **Home** and **Groups** pages list all businesses and groups respectively. Create a new page that accepts the id of a business or group and displays just those details. Feel free to add to the business or group objects if you'd like more data to work with.
4. Update the **Home** or **Groups** page to allow a user to navigate to your new **business-profile** or **group-profile** page.
5. The **not-found** page is currently blank. Help users feel less lost when they encounter the page by adding whatever you feel like to it. Something playful is always welcome.

Don't spend too long on this activity. If you find yourself stuck or spending too long on something, move on and simply let us know.

### Submitting ###

Once you've completed as many tasks as you're comfortable with, please upload your code to a Github or Bitbucket repo and share the location with your primary Cynch contact.
